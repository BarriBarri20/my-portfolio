I'm an ICT engineering student in **Tunisia** at ENISo. I'm currently looking for new adventures, where I can ship softwares and ship engineering products to the people.

I have been working as Freelancer for different projects basically using **Python** language, Also I have some experience with teaching and mentoring people to how to solve real life solutions with computers. As for this time, I am doing more artificial intelligence solutions, and reinforcement learning, but still continuig to ship softwares. I am doing SW engineering as hobby, and I am trying to learn more about it.
I ü§ç every thing about technology!

Thanks to **Timothy Lin** for the
[tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It helped me when I haven't any idea how to create a blog from scratch. My code isn't like the starter code because I changed a lot of code :)
